\begin{defin}[Fibration]\label{ayaya}
A fibration is a mapping between two topological spaces that has the homotopy lifting property for every space \(X\).
\end{defin}

\begin{proof}
To prove it by contradiction try and assume that \cref{ayaya} the statement is false,
proceed from there and at some point you will arrive to a contradiction.
\end{proof}
